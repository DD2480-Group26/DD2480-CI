# DD2480-CI

This project implements the [Continous Integration (Asssignment 2)](https://kth.instructure.com/courses/31884/assignments/185708).

This program is the core code for a CI server linked to GitHub. On push the GitHub repository send an https request to the server. The server then clone the repository, compile and test the code. 

## Project structure
The main class are located in [`ci/src/main/java`](ci/src/main/ja).

### Group state
According to the checklist for Way-of-working given in “Essence -kernel and language for software engineering methods,” (Omg.org, 2018), the group could be said to be in the “Collaborating” state. Our communication is clearly better than it was during the first assignment. For example, a few days after the first assignment presentation, we did a reflection on the points that could be improved in our workflow. In particular, before every meeting, everyone should define the points that need to be discussed. This made the meetings quicker and more efficient.  If someone needs some help on an issue, we also decided to do small meetings with 2 or 3 people. Finally, most of the work is done, and every team member knows and trusts each other, but we are not performing well enough to finish the P+ requirements in time. Because of this point,  we don’t think that we can pretend to be the “Performing” state for now. We are aiming to reach this state for the next assignment.
